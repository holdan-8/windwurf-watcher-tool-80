# 🌲 WINDWURF – Storm Damage Detection in Swiss Forests

WINDWURF is an interactive tool to rapidly assess storm damage in Swiss forests using openly available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery provided via the swisstopo [swissEO S2-SR](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/satellitenbilder-swisseo-s2-sr) Product. Developed during [Data Hackdays Bern 2025](https://hack.data-hackdays-be.ch/project/60), this project helps the Amt für Wald und Naturgefahren (AWN) get timely insight into storm-related forest disturbances over 180,000 hectares of woodland — an area too vast for field inspection alone.

## 🪵 Why WINDWURF?

With storms intensifying over the last 50 years, detecting forest damage efficiently is critical for mitigation, logging decisions, and ecological monitoring. WINDWURF empowers authorities with a scalable, transparent, and reproducible approach to disaster response.

## 🚀 What It Does

After a storm event, WINDWURF allows users to[

    Select a date of a storm event

    Automatically get potential forest damage by compare satellite imagery before and after the event

    Highlight forest areas with significant vegetation loss (potential storm damage)

The result: a fast, data-driven overview of potentially affected forest regions.

## 🛰️ How It Works

WINDWURF is powered by Google Earth Engine (GEE) and utilizes Sentinel-2 imagery provided by [swissEO S2-SR](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/satellitenbilder-swisseo-s2-sr) processed with a pixel-wise dNBR (delta Normalized Burn Ratio) analysis.
Core Analysis Steps:

    NBR Calculation:

        NBR = (B8A - B11) / (B8A + B11)

        Computed for pre- and post-storm periods

    dNBR Calculation:

        dNBR = NBR_post - NBR_pre

        Significant vegetation loss → low dNBR values (≤ -0.15)

    Filtering & Masking:

        [Swiss-harmonized Sentinel-2 data](https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/de/satellitenbilder-swisseo-s2-sr)

        Forest-only mask (Swiss BAFU ecosystem data)[https://www.wsl.ch/de/projekte/lebensraumkarte-schweiz-1/]

        Custom 10m cloud (CloudScorePlus) and terrain (swissSURFACE3D) and shadow masks

        Snow masking using NDSI

Outputs:

    ✅ Median NBR before and after the event

    ✅ dNBR layer showing vegetation change

    ✅ Disturbance mask (dNBR ≤ -0.15) highlighting severe impact zones

## 📅 Notes

    60-day comparison window post-storm

    Compared to same window from previous year

    Only forests are analyzed

    Disturbance areas appear in yellow on delta map

    Works best in Summer, not good during wintertime

## 🚀 Next Steps & Future Development

The WINDWURF project has established a solid foundation for storm damage detection in Swiss forests, but several enhancements could further increase its value for forest management:

### Quantitative Analysis Features
- Area Measurement Tool: Implement functionality to calculate the total affected area in hectares for selected regions
- Economic Impact Assessment: Develop an algorithm to estimate financial damage (CHF) based on:
  - Average timber value per hectare
  - Severity of damage (using# dNBR thresholds)
  - Forest type classification

### Quantitative Analysis Features
Historical Analysis
- Storm Event Database: Create a pulldown menu of historical storm events in Switzerland
- Temporal Comparison: Enable comparison between current and past storm impacts on the same forest areas
- Long-term Trend Analysis: Visualize changing patterns of storm vulnerability across decades

### Quantitative Analysis Features
Enhanced Visualization
- Damage Severity Classification: Implement a multi-level classification system beyond binary damage detection
- 3D Visualization: Integrate with swissSURFACE3D for topographic analysis of damage patterns
- Time-lapse Feature: Show forest recovery progress over time after storm events

### Quantitative Analysis Features
Data Integration
- Field Validation Module: Allow foresters to upload ground-truth data to improve algorithm accuracy
- Integration with Weather Data: Correlate damage patterns with wind speed and direction data
- Automated Reporting: Generate PDF reports with statistics for affected forest management units

The implementation of these features would transform WINDWURF from a detection tool into a comprehensive forest storm damage management system, supporting the entire workflow from initial assessment to recovery planning.
